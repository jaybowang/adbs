adbs
====

Control all your connected Android phones in order with one command.

This is a quite simple shell script. 
Useful when you have a few Android phones connected. Control all the Android devices in order using adb so you don't need to copy and paste these devices' serial numbers.

Use adbs.sh just the way you use adb.  

Here are some examples:  
sh adbs.sh install example.apk  
sh adbs.sh uninstall com.example.adbs  
sh adbs.sh shell rm /data/local/tmp/exampleFile
